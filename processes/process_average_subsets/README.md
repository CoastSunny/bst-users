## Description
This process is just a convenience wrapper for process_select_subset and process_average. It allows you to average a set of trials into subsets of a given size (e.g. you have 60 trials and you want to create 10 averages of 6 trials each). Averages will all have an equal number of trials (e.g. if you have 65 trials and ask for 6 files per subset, 5 trials won't be included in any subset).
